# Talon Modules for use with [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/)

These modules contain voice and noise commands to be used with Talon, a hands-free input replacement. Some modules are meant to be used with the Tobii 4C eye tracker, but it is not required for most commands.

Some modules were originally copied from [Talon Community](https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community).


# Prerequisites
- Install Talon
- Install Dragon (most commands may also work with the free built-in voice engine)
- Microphone (built in microphone won't produce great results, a good microphone makes a significant difference)

Follow the [Getting Started](https://talonvoice.com/docs/) section of the Talon docs.
